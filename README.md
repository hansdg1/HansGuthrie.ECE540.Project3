===========================
In this project we will be using the header files named “Matrix.cpp”, "RandomNumbers.cpp" and
"Stats_Support.cpp", along with their associated headers. This code is what has been used in the
homework, and in the examples in class. Also a binary matrix file, called “StatsData.mtx” is on the
website. You will need to download it.

This project will involve writing programs that perform statistical analysis of data, establishing which
sets are related and which are not. Also we will be doing an experiment that will demonstrate the
concept of a Confidence Interval.
